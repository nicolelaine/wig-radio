            <h2>Hello, thanks so much for stopping by!</h2>
            <p>We are a group of four that joined the Women+ in Geospatial Peer Mentorship scheme in October 2023. We meet once a week, and speak to each other about career paths, our day to day work, upskilling, we&#39;ve watched documentaries and discussed it like a book club, it&#39;s been a really supportive network and environment.</p> 
            
            <p>Our legacy project is something we produce at the end of the peer mentorship, and we collectively decided on a podcast, discussing some of the things we do on a weekly basis and also asking the questions we think others in our field and beyond would be interested in. </p>

            <p>We hope you enjoy!</p>
